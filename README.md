## Questionnaires

### Satisfaction with Life Scale

> A 5-item scale designed to measure global cognitive judgments of oneâ€™s life satisfaction (not a measure of either positive or negative affect). Participants indicate how much they agree or disagree with each of the 5 items using a 7-point scale that ranges from 7 strongly agree to 1 strongly disagree.

## Technical Info

- There are three screens in the app.
    - `HomeScreen` contains a button to load the chosen questionnaire.
    - `QuestionnaireScreen` displays the questionnaire which consists of multiple questions shown one at a time.
    - `ResultScreen`shows the user's questionnaire result.
- `setState` is used as the project's state management solution.
- `QuestionnaireService` loads a list of `Questionnaire` models from json.
- The code architecture was designed so that a new questionnaire can be incorporated into the app by simply adding an additional json file.
